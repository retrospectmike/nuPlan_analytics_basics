# nuPlan_analytics_basics
**Read the associated article!**  These files and code snippets accompany my [April 2022 blog post](https://www.retrospectav.com/blog/accessing-the-motional-nuplan-data) on getting at the raw-er data that comes with the Motional nuPlan datasets.  The blog post itself includes these files but I figured I'd make them available on a git repo as well.

Note that as this was based on the April 2022 latest release of the data set, it is unlikely to be compatible with any updates to nuPlan data in the time since.  You can check out the Motional [nuPlan repo](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit) as well if so inspired to get older versions.
